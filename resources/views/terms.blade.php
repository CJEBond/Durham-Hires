		<h1>Hire Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

		<ol>

			<li>The Hirer is solely responsible for the hired kit while it is under their care. This includes transportation and storage until the Technical Hires and Equipment Coordinator has signed off on the successful return of the kit. This is NOT when the kit is returned to the College. Trevelyan JCR accepts no liability for kit out on hire.</li>

			<li>Trevelyan College is not responsible or liable in the event of any noise complaints from use of the equipment or any other form of issue arising from the use of the equipment.</li>

			<li>In the event of breakage, damage, loss or other such acts that render the equipment unusable or damaged in any way, the Hirer is responsible for the replacement of the equipment or monetary value of replacing the equipment. The Hirer has 30 days to implement this.</li>

			<li>All cables must be returned neatly coiled and secured with LX tape where Velcro fasteners are not fitted. All cables must be cleared of any securing devices, materials or residues such as gaffer tape or similar.</li>

			<li>Kit must be returned by the time and date agreed upon collection and written on the supplied pro-forma invoice. Late returns (more than 20 minutes past the deadline) may be fined. If you are unable to return the kit by the allotted time, contact the Technical Equipment Manager at least one hour before the agreed deadline, and an alternative time may be arranged if possible.</li>

			<li>All payment for the hire must be made within 28 days of the VAT invoice date. A VAT invoice will be issued upon the full return of the equipment. Beyond this time period, fines may be incurred at a rate of 50% of the total hire cost per week. Frequent late payments may result in an increased fine.</li>
